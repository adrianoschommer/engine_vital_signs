These files were created to import, process and export reports from a racing category (Brazilian Stock Light) using Marelli ECUs. 
The time slot for data analysis between outings was very limited and this scripts help me to identify issues much faster and reliably.
It can be adapted to any data logger as long it offers any sort of export option, I've also used this during 2019 Mercedes-Benz Challenging using.

Thre is a jupyter notebook explaining how it works and the python files which were the real stuff I used at the race weekends.
The excell exports were also included for reference.
